# Time To Skim

## The Naive Attempt

As of right now, your `.github/workflows/main.yml` should look like

~~~
name: example
on: push
jobs:
  greeting:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo hello world
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

Let's go ahead and teach our CI to build our code. Let's add another job (named `build_skim`) that runs in parallel for right now, and runs the compiler `ROOT` uses.
<br/>
**Note**: `ROOT` is a open source framework uses in High Energy Physics.<!-- ([https://root.cern/](https://root.cern/)).-->

Let's give a try.

~~~
COMPILER=$(root-config --cxx)
$COMPILER -g -O3 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -o skim skim.cxx
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The compilation will result in an output binary called `skim`.

> > ~~~

> {: .solution}

## Check jobs

Let's commit and push the changes we made, and let's go to GitHub to check if both jobs ran.

```bash
git add .github/workflows/main.yml
git commit -m "add build skim job"
git push -u origin feature/add-actions
```

![Job failure root-config]({{site.baseurl}}/fig/actions_parallel_jobs_failure1a.png)
![Job failure root-config details]({{site.baseurl}}/fig/actions_parallel_jobs_failure1b.png)

## No root-config?

Ok, so maybe we were a little naive here. GitHub runners come pre-installed with a wide variety of software that is commonly needed in CI workflows (e.g. for Ubuntu 22.04 runners the list can be found [here](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md)). ROOT is not pre-installed, so we will have to add a step to install it ourselves. After reading the [ROOT documentation](https://root.cern/install/#run-in-a-docker-container), we find that a convenient way to run it on various systems is using something called a Docker container.

There are several tools that are used for containerization, like Docker, Podman, and Apptainer (formerly Singularity). For this tutorial you don't need to know anything about containerization. You can just think of this as the base software set that comes pre-installed on the system that runs your code.

We will be using the Docker images hosted at the [`rootproject/root` Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rootproject/root). Let's start by using the image with tag `6.26.10-conda`.

```yaml
build_skim:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  container: rootproject/root:6.26.10-conda
  steps:
    - name: checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: build
      run: |
        COMPILER=$(root-config --cxx)
        $COMPILER -g -O3 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -o skim skim.cxx
```

Note the extra line `container: rootproject/root:6.26.10-conda` that specifies the container image that we want to use. Since it comes pre-packages with ROOT we no longer need to have a step to install it. This image also contains other tools that we will need for the rest of the tutorial.

{: .challenge}

Ok, let's go ahead and update our `.github/workflow/main.yml` again, and it better be fixed or so help me...

## Ways to get software

As we saw before, GitHub pre-installs many common software packages and libraries that people might need, but often we need to install additional software. There are often actions we can use for this, like `actions/setup-python` to install python or `mamba-org/setup-micromamba` to install Mamba (an alternative to Conda). These actions are simply repositories that contain scripts to install or perform certain actions. You can find more information about these actions by going to github.com/\<name-of-action\>. For example, for `mamba-org/setup-micromamba` you can find more information at [https://github.com/mamba-org/setup-micromamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/setup-micromamba).


If we wanted to use Conda instead of Docker, our `build_skim` job would look like this:

```yaml
build_skim:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  defaults:
    run:
      shell: bash -el {0}
  steps:
    - name: checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install ROOT
      uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v1
      with:
        environment-name: env
        create-args: root
    - name: build
      run: |
        COMPILER=$(root-config --cxx)
        FLAGS=$(root-config --cflags --libs)
        $COMPILER -g -O3 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -o skim skim.cxx $FLAGS
```

## Building multiple versions

Great, so we finally got it working... Let's build both the version of the code we're testing and also test that the latest ROOT image (`rootproject/root:latest`) works with our code. Call this new job `build_skim_latest`.

# Dependabot for updating gh action version

Github actions are accompanied by the tags ("@v2"...) which are versions/tags of that action. One might need to update this tags for example from "@v2" to "@v3" because the Github actions developers may fix existing bugs to the action or there may be other updates.

However, this process can be automated by using "Dependabot" which ensures that the workflow references the updated version of the action. If that is not the case, the Dependabot will open a pull request updating the tag of the Github action.

The dependabot action can be added to a Github repository by creating the file `dependabot.yml` in the `.github/` folder. The content of the file looks like this [(Link to the dependabot.yml)](https://github.com/hsf-training/hsf-training-cicd-github/blob/gh-pages/.github/dependabot.yml):

~~~
version: 2
updates:
  # Maintain dependencies for GitHub Actions
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
 ~~~
{: .language-yaml}

where interval is the frequency of looking for updates to Github actions.
