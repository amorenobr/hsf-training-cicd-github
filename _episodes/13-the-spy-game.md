In the previous lesson, we saw that the executable `skim` takes 5 arguments: input (remote data), output (processed data), cross-section, integrated luminosity, and scale.

Let's consider the following values
```
input: root://eosuser.cern.ch//eos/user/g/gstark/AwesomeWorkshopFeb2020/GluGluToHToTauTau.root
output: skim_ggH.root
cross_section: 19.6
integrated_luminosity: 11467.0
scale: 0.1
```
<!--
root://eosuser.cern.ch//eos/user/g/gstark/AwesomeWorkshopFeb2020/GluGluToHToTauTau.root
root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/root-eos/HiggsTauTauReduced/GluGluToHToTauTau.root
-->

Our YAML file should look like
~~~
...
 skim:
   needs: build_skim
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   container: rootproject/root:6.26.10-conda
   steps:
     - name: checkout repository
       uses: actions/checkout@v4

     - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
       with:
         name: skim6.26.10

     - name: skim
       run: |
         chmod +x ./skim
         ./skim root://eosuser.cern.ch//eos/user/g/gstark/AwesomeWorkshopFeb2020/GluGluToHToTauTau.root skim_ggH.root 19.6 11467.0 0.1
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

What about the output?
~~~
>>> Process input: root://eosuser.cern.ch//eos/user/g/gstark/AwesomeWorkshopFeb2020/GluGluToHToTauTau.root
Error: n <TNetXNGFile::Open>: [ERROR] Server responded with an error: [3010] Unable to give access - user access restricted - unauthorized identity used ; Permission denied

# Access Control

The data we're using are on CERN User Storage (EOS). As a general rule, access to protected data should be authenticated, CERN canâ€™t just grab it!.
It means we need to give our GitHub Actions access to our data. CERN uses `kinit` for access control.

Anyhow, this is pretty much done by executing `echo $USER_PASS | kinit $USER_NAME@CERN.CH` assuming that we've set the corresponding environment variables.

If you are not a CERN user, don't worry. We have a backup solution for you!
You can use this file `root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/root-eos/HiggsTauTauReduced/GluGluToHToTauTau.root` and skip the rest of this lesson.

> ## Running example
>
> Sometimes you'll run into a code example here that you might want to run locally but relies on variables you might not have set? Sure, simply do the following
> ~~~
> USER_PASS=hunter42 USER_NAME=GoodWill echo $USER_PASS | kinit $USER_NAME@CERN.CH
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
{: .callout}

# GitHub secrets

We first have to store our sensitive information in GitHub:

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Select `Settings`.
3. In the left sidebar, go to `Secrets and variables`, then `Actions`, and then `New repository secret`.
4. Type `USER_NAME` in the Name input box and add your username in the Secret input box.
5. Similarly add `USER_PASS` as well.

## Naming your secrets

Note that there are some rules applied to secret names:

- Secret names can only contain alphanumeric characters ([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9]) or underscores (_). Spaces are not allowed.
- Secret names must not start with the GITHUB_ prefix.
- Secret names must not start with a number.
- Secret names must be unique at the level they are created at. For example, a secret created at the organization-level must have a unique name at that level, and a secret created at the repository-level must have a unique name in that repository. If an organization-level secret has the same name as a repository-level secret, then the repository-level secret takes precedence.



> ## Access secrets
> The secrets you've created are available to use in GitHub Actions workflows. GitHub allows to access them using secrets context: $\{\{ secrets.\<secret name\> \}\}.
>
> e.g:
>
> ~~~
> echo {% raw %}${{ secrets.USER_PASS }}{% endraw %} | kinit {% raw %}${{ secrets.USER_NAME }}{% endraw %}@CERN.CH
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}

# Adding Artifacts on Success

As it seems like we have a complete CI/CD that does physics - we should see what came out. We just need to add artifacts for the `skim` job. This is left as an exercise to you.

> ## Adding Artifacts
>
> Let's add `artifacts` to our `skim` job to save the `skim_ggH.root` file. Let's have the artifacts expire in a week instead.

And this allows us to download artifacts from the successfully run job.
